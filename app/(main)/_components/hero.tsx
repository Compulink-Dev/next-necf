            The National Economic Consultative Forum (NECF) originated from the
            Private and Public Sectors participation at the International Smart
            Partnership Dialogue in July, 1995 at Langkawi Island in Malaysia.
            Experts from the private sector, labour, academia, civic society
            approached the Government for the development of a smart partnership
            institution that would be the think tank for the country. This
            process led to the establishment of the National Economic
            Consultative Forum on 17 July, 1997 after a series of consultative
            meetings amongst stakeholders.

          <p className="my-4 leading-relaxed">
            The imperative to create the NECF was necessitated by the need to
            tap into, and maximize existing skills and resources in key public
            institutions, private sector groups, civil and professional groups,
            as well as individuals with vested interests in the development of
            the economy. The creation of the NECF was thus based on the
            assumption that no particular sector or a group of individuals has a
            monopoly of skills or competencies to grow and develop the economy.
